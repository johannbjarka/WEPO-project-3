# WEPO project 3
Web based student evaluation built with AngularJS.

## Prerequisite, must have the following programs installed
* NodeJS
* Chrome
* Python

## Installation and running
* Run start-init.bat

## Code Coverage
* To see code coverage, navigate to client/coverage/PhantomJs... and view index.html

## Known bugs
* Due to limitations in the API the multiple answer questions don't work. 
* Also because of a bug in the API, the count variable of multiple choice questions is always 0. Therefore we inject dummy data to display charts.
